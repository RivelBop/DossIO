# Security Policy
We are planning to add encryption to data packets and additional security measures like allowing the host to control 
what clients can join the session. At the moment, no data is encrypted, so be WARNED! 
## Supported Versions
Typically the most up to date versions of DossIO will feature the latest security protocols.  
WARNING: Older versions of DossIO will not be updated with the latest security.
